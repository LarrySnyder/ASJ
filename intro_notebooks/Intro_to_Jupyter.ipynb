        "## Why (Jupyter) Notebooks?\n",
        "Notebooks are used for *literate programming*, a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984, in which a programming language is accompanied with a documentation language, or a natural language. In other words, the computer program has an explanation in a natural language. This approach to programming effectively treats software as works of literature ([Knuth, *Literate Programming*](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf)).  It helps readers and users to have a strong conceptual map of what is happening in the code and also have clarity on the flow and logic of the code/program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jupyter leverages this idea and enables users to create and share documents that combine code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and rich media. Notebooks are multipurpose and can be used in any discipline. The notebook is like a laboratory notebook, but for computing. Researchers can write code to work with their data while supplementing their methods with explanations, analysis, or hypotheses. Notebooks are also used in education because they enable students  to engage with content presented in different forms, experience computation with no prior experience, and practice programming in a scaffolded way. \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "> ðŸ‘“ In ISE/WGSS 296, we'll be using Jupyter notebooks to introduce you to how algorithm designers implement their algorithms, to learn about issues of social justice using real-world data sets, and to learn how to reason about the human choices embedded in algorithms.\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "You're using this Jupyter notebook in Google's Colaboratory system (or **Colab**, for short). Colab is only one of many ways to access a Jupyter notebook, but it's convenient for us since it can be shared easily, it lives in the Google ecosystem, and it bypasses some of the annoying Python-related stuff that you'd need to do if you run Jupyter locally on your computer."
