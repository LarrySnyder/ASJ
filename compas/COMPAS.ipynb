In their analysis, ProPublica  used data from defendants with risk scores from Broward County from 2013 to 2014 to test for statistical differences in outcomes for Black and white defendants, which ultimately highlighted racial disparities that exist within the algorithm. ProPublica came to the conclusion that COMPAS utilizes data from a criminal justice system with a history of racial injustices, thus continuing to disproportionately target and arrest Black people in comparison to their white counterparts. While the COMPAS algorithm treats racial groups similarly in a certain sense (which we will explore below), which may make it appear to be neutral, ProPublica's data analysis and reporting emphasized the bias against Black defendants and their communities that COMPAS produced from this line of thinking, a claim that Northpointe has disputed (as we will see later).\n",
