# Algorithms and Social Justice (WGSS/ISE 296)

This course explores how algorithms—which drive everything from Internet search engines to predictive policing software and generative AI—reflect and magnify social inequality. Topics include race, gender, sexuality, and class in the context of policing and punishment, search engines and social media, and ranking and rating. A key goal of the course is to instill in students from technical fields an awareness of how social structures are a part of their work, so that their design choices are informed, from the ground up, by humanistic inquiry. Conversely, the course provides humanists with deeper awareness of how technical tools shape—and are shaped by—humanistic thought. Readings, discussions, and assignments are designed to cultivate transdisciplinary competence in the history of science and technology, feminist/critical race theory, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) and to encourage peer-to-peer learning across the humanities, social science, and engineering.

This course is taught by **Professors [Suzanne Edwards](https://english.cas.lehigh.edu/content/suzanne-edwards) and [Larry Snyder](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/larry/).** It is cross-listed between Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies ([WGSS](https://wgs.cas.lehigh.edu/content/welcome-women-gender-and-sexuality-studies)) and Industrial and Systems Engineering ([ISE](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise)) at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/).
